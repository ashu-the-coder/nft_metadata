# Smart Contract Deployment Summary

## Contract Information
- **Contract Name**: XineteDecentralizedStorage
- **Contract Address**: `0x07E51859E5C96090754453D5b67CD3791a4eB00E`
- **Network**: SKALE Testnet (`lanky-ill-funny-testnet`)
- **Deployment Date**: August 29, 2025
- **Block Number**: 5526673

## Environment Updates
The following environment files have been updated with the new contract address:
- `frontend/.env`
- `frontend/.env.production`

## Contract ABI
The contract ABI has been updated in:
- `frontend/src/contracts/XineteDecentralizedStorage.json`

## Verification Status
The contract could not be automatically verified on the block explorer because the SKALE testnet is not a supported network by the Hardhat verification plugin. Manual verification may be required if needed.

## Next Steps
1. Test the frontend against the new contract
2. Monitor contract interactions to ensure everything works as expected
3. Proceed with any frontend deployments using the updated configuration

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the contract interaction:
- Double-check that the ABI in the frontend matches the deployed contract
- Verify that the wallet is connected to the SKALE testnet
- Ensure the RPC URL is correctly configured in the frontend
