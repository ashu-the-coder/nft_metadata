## Next Steps Before Deployment

1. Run the deployment setup script:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-deployment
   ```

2. Edit the .env files with production values:
   - Root `.env` for smart contract deployment
   - Frontend `.env.production` for frontend configuration

3. Deploy the smart contract:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy-contract
   ```

4. Update frontend configuration with the deployed contract address

5. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. Deploy the frontend to your chosen hosting service

7. Configure your IPFS node with proper CORS settings

8. Test the deployed application thoroughly

## Post-Deployment Tasks

1. Monitor the application for any issues
2. Ensure IPFS content remains properly pinned
3. Consider setting up automated monitoring
4. Plan for regular updates and maintenance
